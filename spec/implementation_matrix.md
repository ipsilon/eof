# Specs

## Megaspec

[**Megaspec**](./eof.md) is ready and main source of truth.

- Alternative version without an irregular state change is discussed: https://github.com/ipsilon/eof/pull/78

## EIP updates in progress ðŸš§

EIP contents are being updated to match up with the **Megaspec**:

- **EIP-7620** - ethereum/EIPs#8358 (mostly clarifications)
- **EIP-7620** - irregular state change discussion pending, to be filed after https://github.com/ipsilon/eof/pull/78 concludes

# Implementations

## Besu

Currently EOF is in a branch [mega-eof](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/tree/mega-eof)
