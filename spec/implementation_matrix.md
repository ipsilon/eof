# Specs

## Megaspec

[**Megaspec**](./eof.md) is ready and main source of truth.

Pending updates addressing recent feedback:

- **A tweak to the EOF validation of creation opcodes** - https://github.com/ipsilon/eof/pull/86

## EIP updates in progress

EIP contents are being updated to match up with the **Megaspec**:

- **EIP-7620** - ethereum/EIPs#8522 (Remove TXCREATE, InitcodeTransaction and the Creator Contract)

# Implementations

## Besu

Currently EOF is in a branch [mega-eof](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/tree/mega-eof).

## erigon++

[Erigon++ is a version of Erigon using Silkworm as the execution engine.](https://erigon.tech/erigonpp/) Since Silkworm uses evmone, it receives the feature from upstream.

## ethereumjs

Ethereumjs in 2022 has merged the initial EOF EIPs into mainline, and then worked on the late 2022 version in [PR#2453](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/2453). This code can be considered stale.

## geth

Current work-in-progress implementation resides at: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/29518

## Nethermind

Nethermind currently has EOF support in the branch [feature/evm/eof](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/commits/feature/evm/eof/)  ([PR#6896](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/pull/6896)).

## Solidity

Last implementation resides at https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13825.  This is based on the December 2022 version of EOF.

## Vyper

There is a contributor submitted PR from mid 2023 implementing some of EOF: https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/pull/3457
